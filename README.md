# SWIG Example

This is an example of how to use CMake with the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) interface generator. It is meant for those
interested to use as a guide to setting up a project built by CMake with interfaces in other languages generated by
SWIG.

### Languages
This example currently generates interfaces for the following languages:

* Python

I will add languages as I need to use them. Anyone that wishes to add another language, feel free to open a pull request
and let me know if there are any issues with using the installation procedure described below with your language.

### Installation
A large part of this example is how to install both the C/C++ libraries that SWIG is wrapping as well as the generated
wrappers. After a good bit of trying different approaches, the following is the current approach:

---

##### C/C++ Libraries
C/C++ libraries are installed with the standard `make install` command with `install` targets in the CMake
configuration.

##### Wrapper Libraries
Wrapper library installation of both the C libraries and target language libraries generated by SWIG are handled by
the target language's packaging system. In addition, a target `make install-<LANGUAGE>` is added to the CMake
configuration to run anything that needs to be run in the target language.

### Use with another project
* Copy the swig-example level CMake script and bindings into your target project source directory.
* Edit the CMakeLists.txt script, line 5, and change the project name
* Remove the external link to liba.lib, line 21
* Change the filename of the .i interface file to <project name>.i.
* Change the C++ header files in swig-example.i to your target headers 
* Run cmake with the BUILD_BINDINGS flag enabled
* Build the generated IDE solution
